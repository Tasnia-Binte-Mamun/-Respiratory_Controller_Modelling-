# Respiratory Controller Modelling through Matlab-Simulink

Modeling the chemoreflex regulation of respiration and determining the steady state operation under normoxia and hypoxia condition.

In normoxic conditions, breathing is controlled almost exclusively by the level of CO2 in the arterial blood. However, upon ascent to altitude or during inhalation of a gas mixture containing low O2 content, there is an additional drive to breathe due to hypoxia(PaO2 drops below 70 mmHg).

Since the metabolic consumption rate of O2 and the metabolic elimination rate of CO2 are relatively constant in the steady state, a higher level of ventilation would lead to an increase in PaO2 and a decrease in PaCO2, which in turn would lower ventilation- NEGATIVE FEEDBACK SYSTEM!
